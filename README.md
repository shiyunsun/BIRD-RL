# Deep Q learning for Flappy Bird üê§
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Q Network (DQN) to play the Flappy Bird game. The DQN is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to play the game by interacting with the environment and updating its Q-values based on the observed rewards.Click [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a1lPtSu9Fw) to see the full demo of the pre-trained agent achieving a score of 112
